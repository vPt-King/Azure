# Some common Cloud Services

## Compute
virtual machine computer run in cloud 

## Storage
Having virtual hard drive that can store file

## Networking
Virtual network being able to define internet connection or network isolations

## Database
Virtual database for storing data or database for general puporse web-application

# Type of cloud services
## SaaS Software as a service
A product that is run and managed by the service provider , don't need to worry about how the service is maintained, it just works and remain available.
Example: Salesforce, email, Office 365.

## PaaS Platform as a service
Focus on the deployment and management of your apps. Don't worry about provisioning , configuring or understanding the hardware OS
Example: Heroku , Google app engine

## IaaS Infrastructure as a Service
The basic building blocks for Cloud IT. Provides access to networking features, computers and data storage space. Don't worry about IT staff, data centers and hardware.

Example: Azure, AWS, OCI

# Cloud Deployment mode
## Public cloud
Everything built on the Cloud provider : Cloud native

## Private Cloud
Everything on the onpremise like Openstack

## Hybrid
Using both cloud and on premise

## Cross Cloud
Using multiple cloud providers aka multi-cloud, hybrid cloud

# High availablity
Running accross multiple Availability zones ensures that if 1 or 2 server down, the service remains available

Azure loadbalancer : allows to distribute traffic to multiple servers in one or datacenter, if 1 server or datacenter become unavailable , the load balancer will route the traffic to only available datacenter or server

# High Scalability
increasing capacity based on the demand of traffic, memory and computing power

```
- Vertical scaling : (Up) Upgrade to a bigger server
- Horizonal Scaling : (Out) More server
```

# High Elasticity
Your ability to automatically increase or decrease your capacity based on the current demand of traffic, memory and computing power
Using only with horizonal Scaling

Technology using:
`Azure VM scale sets : Automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule`

`SQL server strech Database: Dynamically stretch warm and cold transactional data from Microsoft SQL server 2016 to Micorsoft Azure`

# Fault Tolerance
Ensure that no single point of failure , prevent chance of failure

Some service: `Azure Traffic Manager` DNS-based traffic balancer to failover from a failing primary system to a standby sencondary system

# High Durability
Your ability to recover from a disaster and to prevent the loss of data. The solution that recover from a disaster is known as Disaster Recovery (DR)

# Business Continuity Plan (BCP)
A business continuity plan (BCP) is a document that outlines how a business will continue operating during an unplanned disruption in services

## Disaster Recovery options
We need to trade cost and time to recover
```
- backup and restore: backup data and restore it to new infrastructre
- Pilot light: Data is replicated to another region with the minimal services running
- Warm standby: Scale down copy of your infrastructure running ready to scale up
- Active/active: always ready
```

# Global infrastructure - Regions and Geographies

## Region
group of multiple datacenters : Azure has 58 regions available accross 140 countries

Paired region
```
Every region is paired with another region 300 miles away
=> Only one region is updated to ensure no outage
Some azure region rely on paired region for DR
```

Region type
```
Not all azure cloud services are available in every region
+ Recommended region: A region that provides the broadest range of service capabilities and is desgined to support availability zones
+ Alternate region : A region that extends Azure's footprint within a data residency boundary where a recommended region also exist. Not design to support AZs.

+ Special region: Region work with government
```


## Geography
Geography is discreet market of two of more regions
that preserves data residency and compliance boundaries

## Availability zones
Availability zones (AZ) is physical location made up one or more datacenter

A region will generally contain 3 datacenter

## Availability zone supported region
Not every region support Availability zones
These region as known as Alternate or Other
Recommended Regions support 3 AZ

# Fault and update domain
An availability zone in Region is combination of a fault domain and update domain
```
+ Fault domain : A logical grouping of hardware to avoid a single single point of failure within an AZ, group of virtual machines that share a common power source and network switch

+ Update domain : Azure may need to apply updates to the underlying hardware and software, update domains ensure your resources do not go offline

+ Availability set : a logical grouping that you can use in azure to ensure that the VMs you place in the Availability Set are different fault/update domains to avoid downtime
```

Each VM in an availability set is assigned a Fault domain and update domain

# Azure global infrastructure
🟦 1️⃣ Azure Global Infrastructure gồm những gì?
🔹 1. Regions (Vùng)

Một Region = 1 khu vực địa lý (VD: Southeast Asia, Japan East)

Mỗi region có 1 hoặc nhiều datacenter

Khi tạo VM, VNet, DB → bắt buộc chọn region

📌 Ví dụ:

Southeast Asia → Singapore

East Asia → Hong Kong

Japan East → Tokyo

🔹 2. Availability Zones (AZ)

Trong 1 region

Gồm nhiều datacenter độc lập

Mỗi AZ:

Nguồn điện riêng

Mạng riêng

Làm mát riêng

👉 Mục tiêu: chống sự cố datacenter

📌 Ví dụ:

Japan East có AZ 1, 2, 3

Nếu AZ 1 sập → AZ 2, 3 vẫn chạy

🔹 3. Region Pairs

Azure ghép cặp region để:

Disaster Recovery

Replication

Update có kiểm soát

📌 Ví dụ:

Southeast Asia ↔ East Asia

Japan East ↔ Japan West

👉 Khi 1 region gặp thảm họa → failover sang region pair

🔹 4. Edge Network

Hệ thống Azure Front Door, CDN, DNS

Đặt gần người dùng cuối

Giảm latency, tăng tốc truy cập

👉 User ở VN → request có thể vào edge gần nhất

🟩 2️⃣ Azure Global Infrastructure dùng để làm gì?
🎯 Mục tiêu chính
Mục tiêu	                 Ý nghĩa
High Availability	         Tránh downtime
Disaster Recovery	         Phục hồi thảm họa
Performance	                 Truy cập nhanh
Compliance	                 Tuân thủ luật
🟨 3️⃣ Ví dụ dễ hiểu (rất hay dùng khi phỏng vấn)

Bạn có app cho user Việt Nam và Nhật Bản

Thiết kế:

App đặt ở Southeast Asia

Backup sang Japan East

CDN phân phối nội dung

👉 Nếu Singapore lỗi → Nhật vẫn chạy
👉 User VN truy cập nhanh

🟧 4️⃣ Phân biệt nhanh (rất hay bị hỏi)
Khái niệm	                Nghĩa
Region	                    Vùng địa lý
Availability Zone	        Datacenter độc lập trong region
Fault Domain	            Nhóm phần cứng
Update Domain	            Nhóm update
Region Pair	                Cặp region
